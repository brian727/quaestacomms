        <h2 class="blog-post-title">What is Cosmic Ray Sensing?</h2>
  
        <p>Everyday, our planet is showered with cosmic rays not only from the Sun, but from the entire galaxy. These cosmic rays are filtered by the Earth’s atmosphere, creating secondary cascades of neutron particles tumbling down to the surface, colliding and scattering along the way.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Soil moisture has a significant role in moderating weather and climate. Soil moisture levels are emerging as an important topic for various interests across many sectors.</p>

              <p>Although the total amount of water stored in soil is much less than that stored in oceans, fluxes of water into and out of soils can be large, making soil moisture monitoring important.</p> 
                
              <p>The role of soil moisture in the environment remains “the least well understood.” 
                Researchers at the University of Arizona have honed in on the methods using neutrons to measure soil moisture</p>
              
              <h2>COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System</h2>
              <p>The technology and techniques used are called COSMOS, or Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Observing System. 

                <p>It allows average-area soil moisture monitoring at a hectometer scale.</p>
                
                <p>UA researchers found by measuring neutron activity from a probe located above ground level, a wider and deeper area can be measured.</p> 
                
              <h3>COSMOS features:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Measures soil moisture at an intermediate scale of hundreds of meters with minimal dependence on soil type</li>
                        <li>Does not contain a radioactive source</li>
                        <li>Automated easily, consumes little energy, and is compatible with low data stream telemetry techniques</li>
                        <li>Can be used jointly with other techniques, thus bridging the gap between point measurements and airborne or satellite imaging</li>
                        <li>Unique features of the cosmic-ray neutron probe make it ideal for providing measurements with the precision necessary and the appropriate scale for meteorological [GLACE Team, 2004] and intermediate- to large-scale hydrological [Ferranti and Viterbo, 2006] and ecological [Rodriguez-Iturbe and Porporato, 2004] applications</li>
                        <li>Measuring snow pack averaged over tens of hectares; assessing permafrost melting; measuring canopy water storage and biomass changes; monitoring irrigated root-water status; and monitoring weight of snow on rooftops</li>
                    </ul>

              <h2 class="blog-post-title">COSMOS vs. Point Probes</h2>
                <p>Point measurements share a critical shortcoming; they are not representative of the surrounding area because soil moisture is spatially heterogeneous over a range of length scales.</p>
                <p>large-scale and long-term soil moisture data for  atmospheric and other applications are practically impossible to obtain using point measurement techniques</p>
               
            <h3>COSMOS Network</h3>
                    <p> COSMOS can serve as a bridge between the specific data derived from point sensors and satellite moisture data.</p>
                    <p>The cosmic-ray method will improve the way of monitoring near-surface water, which will harbinger changes in the assessment of the role of water in the natural environment.</p>

              <h2 class="blog-post-title">Future work</h2>
              <p>Will focus on improved analysis of the neutron intensity time series, analysis of complex signals due to combined effects of moisture in the soil and above the ground surface and due to heterogeneity of soil moisture, and the simultaneous use of multiple probes to extract more information from the measurements.
